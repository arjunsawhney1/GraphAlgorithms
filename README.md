# Graph Algorithms
In this repo, I examine different graph algorithms such as <b>Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, and Bellman Ford</b>. 
Additionally, I implement these algorithms as solutions to common shortest path graph problems. 
I have also modified Bellman Ford's algorithm to detect negative cycles anywhere along the path from the source node to the target node.
