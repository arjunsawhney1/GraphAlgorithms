# Graph Algorithms
In this repo, I examine different graph algorithms such as Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, and Bellman Ford. 
I implemented these algorithms as solutions to common shortest path graph problems. Additionally, I modified Bellman Ford's algorithm to detect negative cycles anywhere along the path from the source node to the target node.
